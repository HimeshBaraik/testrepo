#introduction and variables

#python uses new lines to complete a command (other languages like c cpp uses a semicolon ;)
#python relies on indentation to define scope (other languages like c cpp uses curly brackets {})

#variables

#created when you assign a value to it
#no command for declaring a variable

x = 4
print(x)

#not need to be declared with any particular type and can even change type after they have been set
#specifying a particular data type of a variable: casting

y = int(7)
print(y)

#getting type : type()

print(type(y))
